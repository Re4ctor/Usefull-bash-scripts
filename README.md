Usefull Bash Scripts
===
A list of usefull bash scripts that i have written to help me manage my desktop
---

In the last year i moved from openbox to i3-gaps as my main windows manager and i tried to maintain a minimal setup but still usefull workflow for my desktop.
So, i decided to write some custom scripts to manage some stuff like:

 * music info in my statusbar
 * one-click change beetween laptop monitor and external one if connected
 * a themer scripts that sets up my chosen wallpaper from a sxiv gui as my wallpaper and generates a colorscheme to gtk,rofi,polybar and Xresources
 
I hope you find them usefull!
(i will commit if i add something else)
